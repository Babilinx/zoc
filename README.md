# Zoc

Zoc is a block oriented, stack based concatenative programming language highly inspired by Zig.

# Functionalities
- Compiled
- Stack based
- Concatenative
- Strongly typed
- Programmed in itself
- No hidden allocations
- No hidden control flow
- Somewhat data oriented design
- Portable to *any* architecture

# Concepts
Everything is a block. The file itself, functions, variables etc.

Each block can be called. They can also contain data. They can be named, annonymous and inlined.

Like in Forth (and others), each word needs to be separated by spaces.
The only exception is the stack descriptor.

# Syntax
Everything is evaluated from top to bottom, left to right.

## Comments
Comments are marked as `//` and everything after it is ignored until `\n` (UNIX EOL only).

Doc comments are marked by `///` and are like regular comments. For now nothing is really planned but they should translate to markdown files.

## Stack descriptor
The stack descriptor is only used by the type checker to verify definitions.
The syntax is the following:
```
inT::outT
```
You can group types by putting parenthesis arround them.
```
(T, T)::T
```
If the input or output is null, yon can leave it blank
```
::T
```
Nesting parenthesis is allowed, but does not change anything but help with readability in some cases
```
T::(T, (T, T))
```
The order of the types, from left to right is top of the stack (TOS) to bottom of the stack (BOS)

If you define a word that will be used as a type, put what compose it between the `::`.
define Pos :(u32, u32): {
  x>:u32 y>:u32
  }

## Blocks
There are of two types: normal and assembly block.
But there are also modifiers that change the comportement of blocks: inline and inlinable blocks.

### Normal blocks
Normal blocks are defined outside of the current block. They need to be explicitly called to be executed.

Normal blocks are enclosed by `{` and `}`. As curly brackets are themself definitions, spacing is needed.
```
// OK
{ 1 2 + }
// Not OK
{1 2 -}
```

### Assembly blocks
Assembly blocks are the same as normal blocks but takes between them assembly code. They are delemited by `a{` and `}`.

#### Assembly syntax
Currently used assembly syntax is Intel syntax compiled with NASM.

Each assembly line should end with `;` so it can be multilined.
As `;` is already used, comments are defined by `;;` until the next EOL (`;`).

### Inlined modifier
Inlined blocks are compiled where they are defined. They are needed for `while` loops, as they need a place to jump back.

Inlined blocks adds a `.` to the wanted block syntax.
```
.a{ } .{ }
```

### Inlinable modifier
Inlinable block are inlined where they are called. This is usefull for base blocks like `+` for maximum speed, and space gain.

Inlinable blocks adds a `<` to the wanted block syntax.
```
<a{ } <{ }
```

### Note on modifiers
You *can't* combine both, as it is useless and because it is harder to parse.

## Definitions
In Zoc, mostly everything is defined by a definition. Definitions links to the next declared block. As the langage is strongly typed, they need a stack descriptor so the type checker know what to do.

Definitions are started by the `define` keyword followed by the name of it. The next seen stack descriptor is linked to the most recent definition.

By convention:
```
define myDefinition (...)::(...) { ... }
```

### Naming specifications
A name should always start by a letter (lower or upper case).

If a name starts by `>`, it will only be acessible by point syntax.

### Calling specifications
Calling a definition by its name will do what the block linked to it does.

If the definition return a pointer, yon can directly fetch its data with `@'name'` or store a data of the correct type with `!'name'`.

You can inline a declaration by calling it like the following: `.'name'`. Instead of calling the block, it's compiled content is, well, inlined.

## Types

Types are used in 2 ways:
1. Making sure that types are OK with their usage
2. Getting the number of bytes needed for the specific type

### Integers
Integers are of size 8, 16, 32 and 64 bits and can be signed or unsigned.

They are referenced by `i` for signed and `u` for unsigned numbers follow by the number of bits.
```
i32 u16 u8 i64
```

### Booleans
Booleans are of size 1 byte.
`true` is represented by `1` and `false` by `0`. *But* in Zoc, `true` and `1` are totally different. They are denoted with `bool`.
```bool```

### Pointers
Pointers points to a type, and are themself types.
Fetching a pointer pushes on the stack the dereference of the values it points to.
```
*u8 -> u8
***u32 -> **u32
*(u8, u8, u8) -> u8 u8 u8
*(bool, (*u8, u32)) -> bool *u8 u32
```

### Strings (special)
Strings are delemited by `"` and can be multilines (as it is easyer to parse). They are stocked in data segment and push on the stack its length and pointer. So it is not really a type in itself.

Lenght is of type `u32` and the pointer is of type `*u8` as the string is an array of bytes.

### Operations
You can repeat any type to do, for example, an array.
```
u16 ** 10
```
Note that it only works between parenthesis.

### Type casting
You can cast any output from a function with the syntax `'name':T`.
```
1 6 +:u8
addr @:bool
```

## Static memory allocation
Static memory allocation is done at compile time in the bss segment. At runtime it return the pointer to the type.
The syntax is `:T>`.
```
:u8> // ::*u8
:(bool, u32) // ::*(bool, u32)
```

## Point field definition
You can name a field of memory to access it with point access. They do nothing at runtime, like stack descriptors they assign an offset based on the type.
The syntax if `>'name':T`.
```
>field:u16
>datas:(i32, bool)
```

## Implementation of an enum
```
// Calling Color does not get an input not set an output
define Color :: {
  // Elements are only accessible with point syntax
  define >red ::u8 <{ %iota } // `%auto` is a comptime word. It is like `ioto` in Go. It gets replaced by litteral int
  // Each element return an int. Here u8 is adapted
  define >green ::u8 <{ %iota }
  define >blue ::u8 <{ %iota }
  // Sets back the counter to 0
  %reset
}

Color>red // The integer gets on the stack
```

## Implementation of a struct
```
define Car :(bool, (u32, u32)): {
  define >Pos :(u32, u32): { >x:u32 >y:u32 }
  >started:bool
  >pos:>Pos
}

define my_car ::*(bool, Car>Pos) { :Car> }

false !my_car>started
0 !my_car>pos>x
0 !my_car>pos>y
```
